## ‚úÖ GitHub Sub-Issues

### Query Operations
- [x] List sub-issues of parent issue
- [x] Find parent issue of sub-issue

- [x] Get sub-issue relationship metadata

### CRUD Operations  
- [x] Create new sub-issue under parent
- [x] Add existing issue as sub-issue
- [x] Remove sub-issue relationship
- [x] Move sub-issue to different parent
- [x] Reprioritize sub-issue order

### Limitations Discovered
- [x] GitHub's limits: 100 sub-issues per parent, 8 levels deep
- [x] Beta feature - UI creation more reliable than API
- [x] GraphQL mutations work but require specific field names

## ‚úÖ GitHub Labels

### Label Management
- [x] Bulk label creation from templates
- [x] Label synchronization between repositories
- [x] Color and description management
- [x] Label deletion with safety checks

## ‚úÖ CLI Integration

### GitHub CLI Features
- [x] Authentication with project scope
- [x] GraphQL query execution
- [x] Error handling with retry logic
- [x] Rate limiting respect

### Output Formats
- [x] Table format (human-readable)
- [x] JSON format (machine-readable)
- [x] CSV format (spreadsheet integration)
- [x] Markdown format (documentation)

## ‚úÖ Python Alternatives

### Object-Oriented Implementation
- [x] `GitHubProjects` class with full API
- [x] `GitHubSubIssues` class with CRUD operations
- [x] Enhanced error handling and logging
- [x] Progress tracking for bulk operations

## ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

### Real-World Testing
- [x] Tested on live GitHub projects
- [x] Validated all CRUD operations
- [x] Performance tested with bulk operations
- [x] Error scenarios tested and handled

### Example Data
- [x] Sample CSV files for bulk operations
- [x] Example URL lists for testing
- [x] Demo workflow script

## ‚úÖ Documentation

### User Guides
- [x] Getting started guide
- [x] Complete scripts reference
- [x] Production deployment guide
- [x] Feature-specific documentation

### API Documentation
- [x] GraphQL query examples
- [x] Field type documentation
- [x] Error handling patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### GitHub API Limitations
- Sub-issues are beta feature (may change)
- Project field creation requires manual setup
- Rate limiting affects bulk operations (5000 req/hour)
- Some operations require triage+ permissions

### Implementation Limitations
- No field creation automation (manual setup required)
- Limited to existing project structures
- Dependency on GitHub CLI authentication

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Measured Performance
- Single operations: 1-2 seconds typical
- Bulk operations (10 items): 5-10 seconds with rate limiting
- Field discovery: 2-3 seconds per project
- CSV export/import: Linear with item count

## üîÑ Reliability Features

### Error Handling
- [x] Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [x] Input validation for all operations
- [x] Graceful degradation on partial failures
- [x] Clear error messages with suggested fixes

### Safety Features
- [x] Dry-run mode for destructive operations
- [x] Confirmation prompts for bulk operations
- [x] Backup/restore capabilities via CSV export
