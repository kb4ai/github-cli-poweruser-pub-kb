- **Bulk operations** - CSV import/export workflows tested
- **Error handling** - Retry logic and graceful failure recovery

### Phase 2: Sub-Issues Integration (Completed) 
- **GitHub Sub-Issues research** - Native API support discovered and implemented
- **Hierarchical operations** - Parent-child CRUD operations working
- **GraphQL mutations** - Direct API integration without UI dependency
- **Testing validation** - Real repository testing completed

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Completed)
- **Documentation suite** - User guides, reference docs, production guide
- **Python alternatives** - Object-oriented implementations for all features
- **Example workflows** - Complete demo and testing examples
- **Anonymization** - All content sanitized for public sharing

### Phase 4: Repository Polish (Completed)
- **Modular documentation** - Focused, smaller files with clear navigation
- **Features audit** - Honest assessment of implemented capabilities
- **Production deployment guide** - Based on actual testing experience

## üîç Current State

**Status**: Feature-complete for documented use cases

The toolkit successfully handles:
- Issues ‚Üî Projects workflows with custom fields
- Sub-issues hierarchical management  
- Bulk operations with CSV integration
- Production deployment patterns

**Reliability**: Tested on real GitHub projects with documented limitations.

## üìù Potential Future Considerations

*Only if requested by users with specific use cases:*

### MCP Server Implementation
- Model Context Protocol server wrapper for AI agent integration
- **Note**: Author currently satisfied with direct CLI tool usage by agents

### Extended Integrations  
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers
- Slack/Discord notification integrations
- Jira/Linear bidirectional sync

### Enhanced Automation
- Webhook-based real-time updates
- Advanced field validation rules
- Custom workflow templates

## üéØ Philosophy

**Principle**: Build what's needed, when it's needed, based on real usage.

This toolkit emerged from practical needs and testing. Future development driven by:

1. **User requests** - Real use cases from actual users
2. **API evolution** - GitHub API changes requiring updates  
3. **Bug reports** - Issues discovered in production usage

## üì¨ Request Features

Have a specific use case? Please [file an issue](../../issues) with:

- **Your workflow** - What you're trying to achieve
- **Current limitations** - What doesn't work today
- **Expected behavior** - What success looks like
- **Context** - Your environment and constraints

We prioritize requests with clear use cases and concrete requirements.
